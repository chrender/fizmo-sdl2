Description: SDL2-based Z-machine interpreter for Infocom/Inform games
 This is a SDL2-based Z-Machine interpreter. It is used to play old Infocom
 text adventures (except version 6) and modern interactive fiction as
 created by the Inform compiler. Using the freetype2 engine, it allows for
 proportional font display and supports antialiasing, subpixel-rendering
 and provides HiDPI support. For more information about interactive
 fiction -- and to download many storyfiles -- see http://www.ifarchive.org.
