   Version 0.8.4 -- April 9, 2017
 - Fixed SDL2-event evaluation on startup. This fixes a bug that made the
   interpreter crash when your initial screen size was less than the default
   size. This fix does now also allow resizing the window during frontispiece
   display.
 - Adapted to split-library build.
 - Adapted to replacement of en_US locale with en_GB from libfizmo.
 - Show warning messages if window width or height supplied from the command
   line are too small.
 - Fix startup error messages, this also fixes silent exists in case the
   story file could not be found.
 - Fixed missing output of interpreter-related, fatal in-game-occuring error
   messages.
 - Raised version number to 0.8.4. It should have been in the 0.8 range from
   the beginning, since this is the fizmo distribution version which releases
   the SDL2 interface. The second reasons for the jump from 0.7.1 to 0.8.4 is
   that all modules and frontends have so far gotten their version number
   from the distribution version they were split from, so fizmo-sdl2 now
   follows in this pattern. The new version number should also avoid some
   confusion for all packaging which is based on the modules instead of the
   whole distribution.

   Version 0.7.1 -- August 25, 2016
 - Use tiny-xml-doc-tools for documentation.

   Version 0.7.0 -- July 28, 2016
 - First implementation.
