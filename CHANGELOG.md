   **Version 0.8.4**

 - Raised version number to 0.8.4. It should have been in the 0.8 range from the beginning, since this is the fizmo distribution version which releases the SDL2 interface. The second reasons for the jump from 0.7.1 to 0.8.4 is that all modules and frontends have so far gotten their version number from the distribution version they were split from, so fizmo-sdl2 now follows in this pattern. The new version number should also avoid some confusion for all packaging which is based on the modules instead of the whole distribution.
 - Adapted to split-library build.
